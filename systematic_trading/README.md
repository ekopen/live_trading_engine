# Systematic Trading  

This is part of my overarching **Live Trading Engine** project. Visit [www.erickopen.com](http://www.erickopen.com) to see my projects running live and to view comprehensive documentation.  

## Overview  
Continuously implements and runs machine learning–based trading algorithms, recording execution activity and portfolio performance. It utilizes live market data from the **Market Data Stream** module, historical data from the **Market Data Storage** module, and machine learning models from the **ML Trading Strategies** module.

## Details  
- Downloads machine learning models from AWS after they are generated by the ML Trading Strategies module.  
- Initializes independent portfolios for each strategy (including long-only benchmarks) using simulated cash balances.  
- Combines analysis of historical data from the Market Data Storage module and live prices from the Market Data Stream module to generate buy/hold/sell signals.  
- Trade signals are processed by both an **execution engine** and a **risk engine**, which determine whether to approve or deny a trade. The execution engine does not place real trades but simulates slippage conditions.  
- A **portfolio monitoring engine** continuously records performance metrics, using ClickHouse to log portfolio states, time series of portfolio values, and execution data.  
- When strategies are turned off, they close all positions and revert to a 100% cash balance.  

## Future Improvements  
- Expand tracking of portfolio metrics. Add more risk measures (e.g., Value at Risk, maximum drawdown) and incorporate ratios like Sharpe, as well as cost-based metrics (e.g., cost per trade).  
- Track drawdown of long only positions on a regular basis to close if needed
- Fix sloppiness of differentiating between long/ml strategies when passing through trades to execution, add a risk check/slippage flag
- Improve slippage modeling. Currently, only a time delay is simulated—consider integrating a paper trading platform for more realistic execution behavior.  
- Introduce market orders. The module currently supports only limit orders, which can cause slight inaccuracies in position entry and exit.  
- Enable model refreshes to be triggered by signals (pings) from the ML Trading Strategies module instead of a fixed time schedule.  
- Enhance portfolio initialization and shutdown logic to reconcile simulated portfolios with actual paper trading accounts.
- Create a flag for up/down per strategy.

## Known Isues
- This code is a bit sloppy. When I have time, I need to organize it better to make more sense at first glance.
