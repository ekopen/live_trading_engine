# Systematic Trading 
This is part of my overarching **Live Trading Engine** project. Visit [www.erickopen.com](http://www.erickopen.com) to see my projects running live and to view comprehensive documentation.  

## Overview  
Continuosly implements and runs machine learning based trading algorithims, recording execution activity and portfolio performance. This utilizes both live market data from the Market Data Stream module, and historical data from the Market Data Storage module, and machine learning models from the ML Trading Strategies module.

## Details
- Downloads machine learning models from AWS after they are generated by the ML Trading Strategies module.
- Portfolios for each strategy (including long only benchmarks) are initialized (using simulated amounts of cash) and begin trading independently.
- Combining analysis of historical data from the Market Data Storage model and live prices from teh Market Data Stream module, buy/hold/sell signals are generated.
- Trade signals are processed by both an execution and risk engine, which may deny or approve a trade. The execution enginer does not actually place trades, but does simulate slippage conditions.
- A portfolio monitoring engine continously records model performance, using Clickhouse to record the portfolio, time series of porfolio values, and execution related data.
- When strategies are turned off, they close out positions and return to a 100% cash balance.

## Future Improvements
- Expand tracking of portfolio metrics. Specifically, far more risk metrics (VaR, max drawdown, etc.) should be continuosly calculated and considered for each trading decision.
- Improve modeling of slippage conditions. Right now, it only a time delay is simulated. Consider looking into a paper trading platform for this.
- Introduce market orders. The module currently only supports limit orders which makes strategy opening/closing slightly inaccurate.
- Better orchestrate all the strategies. They should be individually turned on and off and more easily edited without rerunning Python code. Use a JSON file for this.
- Have model refreshes triggered by pings from the ML Trading Strategies module, not on a timed schedule.
- Create better logic for the portfolio initialization/shut down. It should be reconciled with an actual portfolio from a paper trading platform.
